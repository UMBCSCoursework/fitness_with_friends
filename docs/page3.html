        <p style = "text-align: justify">UI Design Task 1 – Version 1:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify"><i> In comparing the two previously illustrated UI sketches for our task 1, we decide on version 1 as the more exemplary of the two, in terms of good design. Version 1’s options bar located at the bottom of each view, especially if extended to include more options, is a great example of the aspect of hierarchical organization within the visibility design principle. Each option gets mapped to a sensical image that logically groups, and hides, all related information in a hierarchical fashion.  Indeed, this aspect of hierarchical organization continues to be exemplified across the views of both version 1 and version 2; version 1, however, does a better job at applying this aspect with regards to a higher content of information, thereby better highlighting the optimal use of this visibility organizational principle. </i></p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify"><i> Though both versions of this task are very similar in their design, it is version 1 that conveys a higher amount of content overall, thereby allowing for a higher degree of specification when moving on to further steps of UI design, such as prototyping. </i></p>

      <p style = "text-align: justify">UI Design Task 2 – Version 2:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify"><i>Although the UI sketch for task 2, version 1, employs the social user experience patterns of sign-up/registration and sign-in in clear presentable manners, registration nevertheless would have benefitted from being provided in the last possible moment of a user’s navigation of the app. We settle on version 2 for a number of reasons:</i></p>
          <p style = "text-align: justify"><i>The first interface of version 2 displays user-relevant data, central to a user’s latest work out plan, immediately upon starting the app (e.g., displaying how many “steps” an individual needs to perform in order to complete their weekly goal). This feature exemplifies the context sensitivity aspect behind the visibility design principle: ensuring that relevant information to a user’s last pre-defined work out plan be made highly visible.</i></p>
          <p style = "text-align: justify"><i>Moreover, the sequence of chronological events, illustrated by Interfaces 2.1, 3, 4, and 5, demonstrates good use of usability goals (i.e., high degree of effectiveness by means of learnability, memorability, efficiency, and utility), design principles (in terms of visibility, feedback, and constraints) and, relatedly, seeks to prevent errors by means of the reduction of cognitive load, the application of a context-sensitive menu, and the ability for actions to be undone, given the freedom to click back to a previous view from anywhere along the sequence. Establishing a logical ‘flow’ across multiple views - representing the set of actions behind registering for a workout with a trainer – both heightens visibility by avoiding kitchen-sink visibility and, relatedly, enhances both the learnability and memorability of the task. Feedback is presented in the form of textual displays, in a subsequent view, to a selection having been made. Moreover, the physical constraint of paths – exemplified by the user interface scroll bar on interface 4 – gives an indication of the amount of remaining trainer names not currently visible. Furthermore, error reduction is maximized thanks to streamlined set of views that guide users through the trainer selection - and registration – process (thereby reducing cognitive load), the capacity for users to go back between views, and the incorporation of a context sensitive calendar menu. These features ensure a high level of productivity for a task that is quickly learned as well as remembered, lending to a high degree of efficiency, and they collectively make for a highly effective user-interface product regarding the underlying task.

        <p style = "text-align: justify"><i> We note that version 1 of task 3, as previously expounded upon, produces a clear and presentable use of the user experience pattern of registration. And though its home screen view exemplifies the visibility aspect of hierarchical organization by simultaneously grouping and shielding logically related information within pressable widgets and an options bar located at the bottom of the interface, we find that version 2 nevertheless employs this principle more fully (by means of greater breadth of options) while, additionally, presents more specificity in its content while conveying the successful use of a number of usability goals and design principles.  </i></p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify"><i> Version 2 of the interface sketches for task 3 communicates the use of (light) feedback by allowing for visible button presses (see view 3.2 and 3.4). This degree of feedback may be enhanced by the use of audible clicks (indicated by the “click” phrase on view 3.4) which, themselves, can be made optional as an inclusivity feature geared towards the vision-impaired. </i></p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify"><i> Version 2 furthermore better enacts another design principle - visibility – by clearly indicating every action through large images that convey semantic meaning behind the information they provide; each view illustrates its buttons with large images and each metric or statistic regarding analysis (see views 3.4 and 3.5) is similarly conveyed with large font and vivid color.  </i></p>
